## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

CSNF is an Open Source initiative tackling the difficulty of providing security assurance for Cloud at scale caused by the large volume of events and security state messaging. The problem is compounded when using multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSP’s) due to the the lack of standardized events and alerts amongst CSP’s.

Cloud Service Providers follow no industry standard in the generation of security event messaging. This gap translates
into increased toil and decreased efficiency for the enterprise cloud consumer. Cloud Security Notification Framework (
CSNF), being developed by the ONUG Collaborative’s Automated Cloud Governance (ACG) Working Group, is aimed to create a
standardization process without sacrificing innovation. Join the ONUG discussion and learn how CSNF will support your
efforts in delivering more efficient Hybrid Multi-Cloud solutions.
